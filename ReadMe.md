#Getting and Cleaning Data

This project is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

#Objective

The objective is to demonstrate the ability to use the tools from the course in a real world scenario to create a tidy dataset.

The following are the instructions for the project:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Files

There is a script file which can be run to generate the tidy dataset.  This script file is entitled run_analysis.R.  There is also
a CodeBook file which details the data sources.  The codebook is largely based on the content provided by the creators of the datasources and as such they have been duely referenced.
